API - interface to facilitate communication between two different softwares.

API key :

This api key confirms that the user wanting to fetch the data is fully authorized or valid user.


GEOLOCATION API:
This is used to get the geographical position of the user.

navigator.geolocation       -> we basically checks if our system supports geolocation api , then only 
                                move to the further step.


basically by getCurrePosition, the system asks the user to share his current position.
if position is shared , then the callback function will run which contains the position.
navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition((position)=>{
    lati = position.coords.latitude;
    long = position.coords.longitude;
})



POSTMAN TOOL:
-> it is an API development Tool which helps to build , modify and testing of api's



OPTIONAL CHAINING OPERATOR:   ?.
-> If we want to access any property from the JSON object , we use optional chaining operator.
-> suppose we had object named data and inside that we had property named temp. we can access it by
    using dot operator like data.temp but suppose if property temp is not there, it gives the error.

-> so here comes the use of optional chaining operator.  data?.temp
-> ? means it firstly checks if the temp property is present inside data or not . if not then it 
    does'nt give error , it just returns undefined , else it retures the required value.
